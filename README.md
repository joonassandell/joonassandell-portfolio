Welcome to the source code of [joonassandell.com](https://joonassandell.com). This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Even though there's no explicit `LICENSE` included my sincere hope is that you'll utilize it solely for _educational purposes, to study and gain insights_. **Please refrain from engaging in any commercial activities with the code, such as selling it or using it to develop your own website**. This approach has been effective previously, and I aim to maintain the code open for everyone. However, if I detect any unauthorized usage online, I may have to make this repository private again. Your cooperation and understanding are greatly appreciated!
